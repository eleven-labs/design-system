# System Props

Inspired by **Chakra UI**, **System Props** allows you to add accessories to your components to modify their style, the only difference is that we do not use **CSS-in-JS** but **CSS Utility Classes**.
**System Props** to improve reusability, predictability, and standardization across our design system.

> Here are the two libraries that inspired the System Props, [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/style-props) and [System Props](https://system-props.com/)

The `SystemProps` interface is composed of `Color System Props`, `SpacingSystemProps`, `TypographySystemProps`, `FlexBoxSystemProps` and `LayoutSystemProps`.
